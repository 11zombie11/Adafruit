Adafruit Python GPIO Library
============================

Library to provide a cross-platform GPIO interface on the Raspberry Pi and Beaglebone Black using the RPi.GPIO and Adafruit_BBIO libraries.

This library depends on either the [RPi.GPIO](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/RPi.GPIO) or [Adafruit_BBIO](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Adafruit_BBIO) library, depending on your hardware platform.

The library is currently in an early stage, but you can see how its used in the [Adafruit Nokia LCD library](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Adafruit_BBIO) to write Python code that is easily portable between the Raspberry Pi and Beaglebone Black.
